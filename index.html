        <div class="text">

          <p>I like to think about nerdy things like developing apps to simplify monitoring and evaluation of advocacy strategies or which tools are best for project management. I can also help you build an organizational website or simple landing page, develop strategies to better engage your community online and write content.</p>

          <p>I'm particularly interested in collaborating with small businesses that have a social conscience, worker owned co-ops, freelancers, advocacy and direct service nonprofits, community based organizations and local governments.</p>

          <p>To me, liberation is freedom for all people from systemic and institutional oppression. Let's work together to make that a reality.</p>

      <h2>Building on a solid foundation with diverse experiences.</h3>
      <p class="lede">I built my first website when I was in Elementary school in Spokane, Washington and have been addicted to computers and the Internet ever since.</p>

      <p>Since then, I've studied Computer Science and Management Information Systems, gotten a degree in Spanish, worked with an International Human Rights nonprofit and lived in New York City. I haven't gotten to travel the world quite yet&mdash;but those plans are in the works!</p>

          <p class="job-title">Digital Communications Manager</p>
          <p><strong>July 2011 to June 2015 in New York, NY</strong></p>
          <p>When I joined IGLHRC in 2011 we were using one system for advocacy and online donations, a second for analog donations, and our website was locked into a third outdated, proprietary content management system. We had to pay developers $400 per hour to modify things as simple as CSS(!).</p>

          <p>It took me 18 months to get everyone on board, but at my urging (and with my offer to manage the project), we hired a shop to liberate the website content by migrating the site to Drupal, eliminate manual data entry for online donations by connecting Drupal and Salesforce, and develop new tools for advocacy. The system wasn't perfect, but it was miles ahead of where we started.</p>

          <p>Working at times as a team of one, with no Director of Communications, and other times with a part-time, then full-time Director and a Web Manager, my responsibilities ran the gamut. My primary tasks were managing the social media presence and all comms-related technology and supporting the traditional press work.</p>

          <p>During my tenure I grew IGLHRC's following on <strong>Twitter</strong> by 556% (+12,366 followers) in total, averaging 46% growth each year. Engagement with tweets increased an average of 65% each year, generating 48.4 million potential impressions over four years. <strong>Facebook</strong> following grew by 127% (+23,732 fans) in total, averaging 23% growth each year. Engagement increased an average of 102% each year, generating 59.6 million potential impressions over four years.

          <p><strong>August 2010 to July 2011 in New York, NY</strong></p>
          <p>One of the most rewarding risks I've ever taken, I moved to New York after graduating to do a year of service as an AmeriCorps Volunteer sponsored by NYC Service.</p>

          <p>I was placed with Learning Leaders to recruit, interview, and train parent and adult volunteers to support classrooms in schools throughout New York City. I also launched a blog with resources for volunteers, managed the organization's social media, and helped out with logistics for events.</p>

          <p>For my senior year at Western, after two years as a Resident Advisor on campus, I joined the University Residences web team. I brought a unique perspective to the team as the only developer with experience on the "other side" using the apps the team built.</p>
          <p>I quickly learned Python and Django and developed an application for resident advisors to organize competitions between their communities within a few months. I spent the rest of the year iterating the app and contributing to other projects with our small, agile team.</p>
